      <h2>Modernizing Knowledge Creation</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Calculingua was born from the frustrations with the current knowledge creation process. Data analysis tools are too expensive in the age of cloud computing and Software as a Service products. Scientific collaboration and sharing is too cumbersome
        because it makes so little use of the full potential of the world wide web. The slow and closed publishing system protects profit interests above knowledge dissemination. Calculingua is modernizing the stack with a low cost Software as a Service
        product.</p>

      <p>Bill began work on Calculingua in May 2012 as a part-time side project. At the time, he was still working full time at GE Appliances in the Connected Home Software Group. He would get up early in the morning, before his wife and three kids woke,
        to work on Calculingua before going to his day job. He maintained this work schedule for nearly two years while bootstrapping Calculingua. In early 2014, he decided that he needed to devote more time to Calculingua, and he resigned from his job
        at GE Appliances, effective May 9, 2014.</p>
      <p>Dr. Burke has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California in Berkeley, with a focus on feedback control systems, machine learning, and micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). His dissertation was entitled Control of Residential
        Load Management Networks Using Real Time Pricing. Dr. Burke received a BS degree from the University of Kentucky in Mechanical Engineering, and he graduated with distinction as Summa Cum Laude in 2000. </p>

      <p>Aaron studied Electrical Engineering, Physics and Philosophy at the University of Louisville, graduating Summa Cum Laude in 2001. He then studied Macromolecular Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, earning a PhD in 2008 with the
        thesis title "White-Light generation and lifetime issues in Organic Light Emitting Devices". He studied under Prof. Jerzy Kanicki.
      </p>
      <p>Aaron returned to Louisville and began work as a patent insurance underwriter at IPISC, later becoming the company's vice president of underwriting. While at IPISC, Aaron took and passed the patent bar and led the company's efforts to expand into
        software and web-based patent risk. Aaron's experience in software patent underwriting and in creating and coding statistical risk models for patent risk led him to pursue software development full-time.
